=================================
New Segment with the improved TPM
=================================
TPM file: eTPM.nii
To run the New Segment in SPM8 using this TPM, you have two options:
1. Use the SPM8 batch editor, go to New Segment, and from the GUI, locate the TPM to the eTPM.nii;
2. Use the "start_seg" script.


================================
Automated Segmentation Clean Up:
================================

main function: mysegment.m
auxiliary functions: binaryMaskGenerate.m, sizeOfObject.m

You will need the following toolboxes:

NIfTI Toolbox: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797


====================
Electrode Placement:
====================

main function: electrode_placement.m
auxiliary functions: cylinder2P.m, coordinate_transform.m

You will need the following toolboxes:

NIfTI Toolbox: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/8797
Natural Cubic Spline: http://www.mathworks.co.jp/matlabcentral/fileexchange/7617

D_74.mat, D_93.mat: the electrode coordinates obtained from EasyCap (http://www.easycap.de/easycap/e/downloads/M1_ThetaPhi.htm), converted by coordinate_transform.m and used by the main function. Of course, you can use any other electrode coordinates as you defined.


================================================================================
Automatically solving the FEM for all possible bipolar electrode configurations:
================================================================================

main function: main.m
auxiliary function: meshProcess.m

You will first need to run meshProcess.m on the mesh file generated by ScanIP. Then run main.m to solve the FEM.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note: All the Matlab scripts need at least Matlab version R2010b with Image Processing Toolbox installed to run properly.
      See the help for each .m file for details.
